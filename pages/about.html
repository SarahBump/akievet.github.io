        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Born and raised in Wisconsin. Lover of pizza + ranch dressing. Graduate from the University of Wisconsin
        with a degree in International Studies - Environmental Focus.
        Business certificate. Spent a year in Copenhagen learning about
        post-modernism, Hegel, and Kirkegaard. Dabbled in Graphic Design. After
        one last six month adventure in Vietnam, I
        moved to New York and learned to code. Finally
        love what I get paid to do. Sometimes vegan, sometimes carnivore,
        most time somewhere in between. Weekend warrior, mountain goat, tech
        nerd. Very skilled at not being bored.
        Someday I hope to build a cabin in the woods with really fast internet and
        a small family of goats to keep me company.
        </p>
        <p>Current hobbies include: hiking, swing dancing, bouldering, painting, electronics
        tinkering, running, bread baking, hammocking, slowly reading my way through Infinite Jest.
